# Active Learning

This repository provides an implementation of an active learning pipeline for (briefly describe the purpose of the active learning pipeline, e.g., classification tasks, object detection, etc.). Active learning is a machine learning approach that aims to reduce the labeling effort required by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation.

## Overview

Explain the purpose and goals of the active learning pipeline. Provide a high-level description of how the pipeline works, its components, and the benefits it offers over traditional supervised learning approaches. Mention any key algorithms or techniques utilized in the pipeline.

## Installation

Describe the steps required to set up the active learning pipeline. Include any prerequisites, dependencies, or specific hardware/software requirements. Provide clear instructions to clone the repository and install any necessary packages or libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/active-learning-pipeline.git
cd active-learning-pipeline/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the active learning pipeline. Explain the different scripts or modules available and their purposes. Describe any command-line arguments or configuration files that need to be set up before running the pipeline.


## Data

Explain the data requirements for the active learning pipeline. Describe the expected format of the input data, including features, labels, and any additional metadata. Provide instructions on how to prepare and organize the data for use with the pipeline. If possible, provide sample data or link to a separate data repository.

## Model Training

Explain how the model training process works within the active learning pipeline. Describe the model architecture, hyperparameters, and any specific training techniques employed. Provide guidance on how to train a model from scratch or load pre-trained weights if applicable.


## Evaluation

Explain how to evaluate the performance of the active learning pipeline. Describe the metrics used to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Provide instructions on how to generate evaluation reports and visualize the results.


## Contributing
